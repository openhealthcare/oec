<h1 class="c0"><span>Open Employment Contract (alpha version)</span></h1>

<p class="c0"><span>UK Version 1.0 alpha</span><span>4</span><span> +
</span><span>Remote Working</span><span> + Average Hours Flexitime + UK Base +
No Collective Agreements + Co-location</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0 c15"><span class="c2">This is an experimental version of an open
system for employment contracts. Both parties will apply common sense and good
faith to its interpretation.</span></p>

<h2 class="c1 c0"><span>Statement of Particulars of Employment</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>This document doubles as a written statement of the
particulars of your employment which we are obliged to give you by section 1 of
the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the terms and conditions of your contract of
employment with us.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>This contract consists of a set of “core” terms and the
following options:</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="#option-remote-working">Remote Working</a>
(you will normally work from home or other place of your choice)</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="option-average-hours-flexitime">Average Hours
Flexitime</a> (your hours of work are an average and there is flexibility about
going under or over those hours)</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="#option-united-kingdom-base">UK Base</a> (you
will be primarily based in the UK and we will never require you to work outside
the UK for more than a month at any one time </span><span>unless by mutual
agreement</span><span class="c23">)</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="#option-no-collective-agreements">No
Collective Agreements</a> (there are no collective agreements — such as with
a union — affecting your employment)</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="#option-co-location">Co-location</a> (we may
require you to work in the offices of other organisations)</span></p>
<hr>

<h2 class="c0"><span>Core terms</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>This part of the contract sets out the core terms of the
open employment contract. There may be one or more additional optional sets of
terms selected by us which will appear after the core terms. The optional sets
also form a part of the contract and are not meant to contradict anything in
the core terms. In the event that they do, a later term overrides an earlier
term.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Employee specific information</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>The following table (referred to in the rest of the
contract as "the particulars") sets out information specific to your employment
which varies from the standard OEC version 1.0. The words in italics in the
left hand column are to aid your employer in entering the correct information
in the right hand column. </span></p>

</table>
<a href="#" name="id.b399wbad097s"></a> 

<h3 class="c0"><span>Date of Commencement:</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>Your employment will start on the date given as the “date
of commencement” in the particulars.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>This date will be the date for the purposes of
calculating your statutory period of continuous employment with the company
unless a different date is specified in th</span><span>at</span><span> table.
This takes into account any unbroken employment with us, or any associated
company and any other service we are required to include as a matter of law.
Service with a previous employer will not ordinarily count as part of your
continuous period of employment with us.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Pay</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>You must always maintain a suitable bank or building
society account into which payment can be made, and provide us with current
details of it. Changes to your bank or building society details must be
notified to us in writing.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If your pay is calculated annually, y</span><span>ou will
be paid 1/12 of your annual pay (as specified in the particulars) each month.
If your pay is calculated monthly, that is the amount you will receive each
month.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If your pay is given hourly, then you will be paid for the
actual number of hours you have worked in any month. For the purposes of hourly
pay, we may choose to start a “month” on any particular day of the month,
eg we may pay you for the hours you work from 4th of one month until 3rd of the
next.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Payment is made </span><span>each month by transfer to your
bank or building society account.</span><span> </span><span>The day on which
we will instruct payment to take place is indicated in the “when payment
takes place” box in the particulars. </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If an overpayment occurs (in other words if we pay money to
you to which you </span><span>were</span><span> not entitled) we reserve the
right to deduct the amount of any overpayment from any payment due to you from
us (for example your salary), or to recover the amount directly from
you.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><a name="h.3znysh7"></a><span>Location</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>Your base is where we may require you to work some or all
of the time. Most employers will specify a base, but if we have written
“none” it means you have no base - perhaps because you will work from home
or be peripatetic. The box labelled “location” in the particulars gives the
location of your first base if you have one. </span><span> </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If you do have a base, w</span><span>e will ordinarily
allow you to work from </span><span>home</span><span> or other location of
your choosing if the nature of your work allows it and </span><span>the place
from which you intend to work </span><span>is suitable for the work you are
doing. Unless we have agreed otherwise </span><span>or you are working on a
remote working contract, w</span><span>e may sti</span><span>ll
</span><span>require you to come to</span><span> your base some or all of the
time. </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>We may change your base to any other place within the area
indicated by the “range of alternatives” entry in the
particulars</span><span>, but we will give you reasonable advance notice of the
change.</span><span> Unless this contract includes the “co-location” or
“foreign working” options, we cannot require you to work permanently from
anywhere else.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We may from time to time require you
</span><span>to</span><span class="c21"> attend </span><span
class="c21">client or project related meetings</span><span
class="c21">,</span><span class="c21"> c</span><span>onferences or other
events. These may be away from your base (if you have one). We will pay any
necessary travel and overnight expenses incurred by your attendance at such
events and we will do our best to give reasonable notice consistent with the
needs of our business.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c5"><span>Travel time to or from work inside the area designated
as your "travel area" in the particulars, will not normally count towards your
working hours </span><span>(eg for the purposes of flexitime or salary based on
hours worked) unless you carry out actual work while you are travelling. Eg if
you work remotely on the train. </span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>If you are travelling to somewhere outside your travel
area, we will ordinarily count at least some of your travel time as “working
time”. Exactly how we treat your travelling time for working time purposes
will be a matter for us, but we will try to be reasonable about it and comply
with any relevant laws in coming to a decision</span><span>. If you are unhappy
with the way in which we have compensated you for travel outside your travel
area, you should let your line manager know.  </span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Hours of Work:</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>We do not specify specific hours for you to start or end
work, nor is there a “normal working day”.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>What we expect you to do is produce work that a competent
person with your job description would produce working for the same length of
time as you. It is up to you to make sure that your starting and ending work
times are appropriate for the work you have to do. </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Some of your working time will be specifically timetabled
by us, for example for meetings and telephone calls, but the organisation of
the rest of your time will be a matter for you. Depending on the needs of the
business we may schedule all, some or none of your time.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>We will try to ensure that tasks allocated to you for
specific times occur at reasonable times of the day and on weekdays (Monday to
Friday) but the needs of the business may require you to carry out tasks at
unusual times, for example if you are required to conduct a telephone
conference with an overseas client.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>We will ensure that any demands on your time outside hours
generally considered to be “working” or “office” hours will not be
unreasonable in the circumstances, and in particular, taking into account the
nature of what we ask you to do and the time we ask you to do it.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>We will require you to record your hours of work
(particularly if you are working hourly) in any reasonable manner we
choose.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We do not give any </span><span>performance
bonuses</span><span> under this contract.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Probation</span></h3>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>During your probationary period, you may be dismissed
without notice. If we dismiss you during your probationary period we do not
have to give you any reason for doing so unless we are required to do so by
law.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Notice Periods:</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>Except in cases of gross misconduct when we reserve the
right to terminate your employment without notice, your employment will only
end either by us giving notice to you or you giving notice to us.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>There is only one notice period under your contract — we
will give you the same period of notice as you are obliged to give to
us.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>After the end of your probationary period, the notice
period will be that given in the particulars</span><span>, unless the statutory
minimum notice is longer, in which case the statutory minimum will
apply.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>At the time this contract was written,
the</span><span> statutory minimum notice period was 1 week</span><span> for
each completed year of continuous service up to a maximum of 12
weeks.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Notice to quit will only be effective if given in
</span><span>writing</span><span>. The Staff Handbook will give details of who
to give the notice to and how the notice should be given.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>Once a notice to quit has been given (whether from you
to us, or from us to you), we reserve the right, at any time after the notice
was given while you are still employed with us, to give you pay in lieu of
notice. This means that we will pay you as a lump sum, the salary that would
otherwise be payable to you during the unexpired portion of your notice
period.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Holiday entitlement:</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>We operate a holiday year as described in the
particulars.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>The amount of paid leave you may take is indicated in the
“holiday” box in the particulars. This amount of leave includes a notional
allowance for public holidays but you are not necessarily expected to take
leave on those days.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>In the first year of your employment your leave will be
reduced on a pro-rata basis, by the ratio of the number of days you work in
that holiday year to the number of working days in that year (for example
260).</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If you are paid hourly, work irregular hours or
part-time</span><span> we will work out your “holiday pay” (i.e. the
amount that you will earn for paid holidays) as follows. Your pay will be a
proportion of your total annual earnings based on the fraction of time you
spend on holiday compared with the rest of the year. For example if you have
5.6 weeks (28 weekdays) holiday in a normal year then your total holiday pay
would be 12.03% of your total earnings for that year. </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>You must give us advance notice before taking your holiday
equal to 4 times the number of days of holiday you will be taking. We reserve
the right to require longer notice, or to refuse a particular period of notice,
where we have a legitimate reason -- for example because of business deadlines.
In such cases we will make every reasonable effort to ensure that you are able
to take the leave to which you are entitled at a later date.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>You may carry over a maximum of </span><span>5
days</span><span>' holiday (or 40 hours holiday pay if you are paid
hourly</span><span>) </span><span>from one holiday year to the next.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>If you leave the company, you will receive payment in
lieu for any part of your holiday entitlement which has accrued but which has
not been taken. Similarly, if you have taken more holiday than you have
accrued, we will deduct the appropriate amount of pay from any payment due from
us to you on the termination of your employment or, if this is insufficient, we
will require you to make up any shortfall.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Absence from Work</span></h3>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>Absence from work due to
</span><span>illness</span><span> is governed by our absence policy found in
the Staff Handbo</span><span>ok. If we have indicated anything (other than
“none”) against “sick pay” in the particulars, these are the main terms
that govern payment during periods of absence due to illness. </span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We will only pay you while you are absent due to illness
if you have complied with any reasonable conditions (including how to report
yourself absent) that we may impose from time to time as part of our absence
policy.</span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>If, for whatever reason, you do not receive sick pay
under this contract, you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Pension</span></h3>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We do not </span><span>operate</span><span> any
employee pension scheme. </span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Retirement</span></h3>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We do not set any compulsory retirement age.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Confidentiality</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>You will not use nor disclose to any other person any
confidential information acquired by you during the course of your employment
for any purpose other than the performance of your duties.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Information Governance</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>You may not during or after the termination of your employment disclose to anyone other than in the proper course of your employment or where required by law, any information of a confidential nature relating to the company or its business or customers. Breach of this clause may lead to dismissal without notice. Guidance on standards expected can be found in the staff code of conduct.</span></p>


<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>After your employment with us, any information that is
sufficiently confidential as to amount to a trade secret must not be used by
you in any future employment, or be disclosed to any other person, while that
information retains its quality as a trade secret.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>On ending your employment with us you must return to us any
physical documents given to you, or generated by you, during the course of your
employment.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>During your employment, you may be given permission to take
copies of documents, including computer programs, planning documents and
ancillary documentation, in which copyright subsists. Copies may be made
available to you in different ways — for example by giving you access to a
version control repository. Unless we agree otherwise, your licence to retain
and use copies of any such material is limited to the period of your employment
with us.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>Once you have ceased to work with us you agree that you
will delete all copies of any such material (including any backup copies) that
remain in your possession or control.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Loyalty</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>You agree that while you are employed by us you will not,
without our prior written consent, carry out any work for or take employment
with any employer who is or could reasonably become a competitor of our
company. Similarly, you agree not to carry out any work for any employer who is
or could reasonably become a client of our company, other than the work you do
as part of your employment with us.</span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>You may carry out any other work provided it does not
interfere with the performance of your duties working for us.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Quality</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>During your employment with us, you must complete your work
to the best of your ability, and at all times must carry out your work in
accordance with our Quality Management Policy.</span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>For further details, consult the Staff
Handbook</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Disciplinary Rules</span></h3>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>Details of our disciplinary rules are contained in the
Staff Handbook</span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>Details of how to lodge a grievance concerning your
employment are contained in the Staff Handbook.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Further rules concerning your employment with us are
contained in the Staff Handbook. Unless otherwise indicated, the contents of
the Staff Handbook form a part of your contract of employment. It is your duty
as an employee to familiarise yourself with the contents of the Staff
Handbook.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>The contents of the Staff Handbook will be varied by us
from time to ti</span><span>me</span><span> and will be published on our file
system, and avai</span><span>lable for all to view</span><span>. We will give
you advance notice of any </span><span>substantive </span><span>change by
email. Any variations to the Staff Handbook will be incorporated into your
contract of employment from the date on which they are notified to
you.</span></p>

Working</span></h2>

<p class="c0 c19"><span>You will not be asked, unless we agree otherwise, to
work from a permanent base. Instead you will ordinarily work remotely from a
place or places of your choosing. For example, this could be at your home or at
a co-working space. You are responsible for ensuring that your place of work is
suitable. In particular:</span></p>

<h2 class="c1 c0" id="optoin-average-hours-flexitime"><span>Option: Average
Hours Flexitime</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>We operate an “average hours” flexible working scheme.
You are expected to work, on average, the number of hours given under
“hours” in the particulars. Our scheme will allow you to work additional
hours over the average to “save up” working time and also to “owe” a
certain amount of working time if you have worked under the average.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>The details of the scheme - which we may vary from time to
time - are found in our Staff Handbook.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>“Overtime” - that is hours worked beyond the maximum
normally permitted by the scheme requires advance agreement with your
manager.</span></p>

<p>“Co-location” means working somewhere other than your base. We may ask
you to co-locate anywhere within the area designated as the “geographical
extent of co-location”. We may not ask you to do so for a period longer than
that given as the “maximum length of any co-location” in the table of
parameters and not for a total longer than that given as the “total period of
co-location in any year” given in the table of parameters.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We will pay all reasonable costs and expenses associated with your
co-location. We may include a detailed guide to what we consider reasonable and
the practicalities of claiming any costs and expenses in the Staff Handbook.</p>
